### Overview

**Geowrangler** is a python package for geodata wrangling. It helps you
build data transformation workflows that have no out-of-the-box
solutions from other geospatial libraries.

We surveyed our past geospatial projects to extract these solutions for
our work and hope that these will be useful for others as well.

Our audience are researchers, analysts and engineers delivering
geospatial projects.

We [welcome your comments, suggestions, bug reports and code
contributions](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geowrangler/discussions)
to make **Geowrangler** better.

### Context

**Geowrangler** was borne out of our efforts to reduce the amount of
boilerplate code in wrangling geospatial data. It builds on top of
existing geospatial libraries such as geopandas, rasterio, rasterstats,
morecantile and others. Our goals are centered on the following tasks:

- Extracting area of interest zonal statistics from vector and raster
  data
- Gridding areas of interest
- Validating geospatial datasets
- Downloading of publically available geospatial datasets (e.g.Â OSM,
  Ookla, Nightlights)
- Other geospatial vector and raster data processing tasks

To make it easy to document, maintain and extend the package, we opted
to maintain the source code, tests and documentation on Jupyter
notebooks. We use [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) to generate the python
package and documentation from the notebooks. See this document to learn
more about our development workflow.

By doing this, we hope to make it easy for geospatial analysts,
scientists and engineers to learn, explore and extend this package for
their geospatial processing needs.

Aside from providing reference documentation for each module, we have
included extensive tutorials and use case examples in order to make it
easy to learn and use.

### Installation

    pip install geowrangler

### Exploring the Documentation

We develop the package modules alongside their documentation. Each page
comes with an *Open in Colab* button that will open the jupyter notebook
in Colab for exploration (including this page).
