**Geowrangler** is a Python package for geodata wrangling. It helps you
build data transformation workflows that have no out-of-the-box
solutions from other geospatial libraries.

We surveyed our past geospatial projects to extract these solutions for
our work and hope that these will be useful for others as well.

Our audience are researchers, analysts, and engineers delivering
geospatial projects.

We [welcome your comments, suggestions, bug reports, and code
contributions](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geowrangler/discussions)
to make **Geowrangler** better.
