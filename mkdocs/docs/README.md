> Tools for wrangling with geospatial data


## Overview

**Geowrangler** is a python package for geodata wrangling. It helps you build data transformation workflows with no out-of-the-box solutions from other geospatial libraries.

We have surveyed our past geospatial projects to extract these solutions for our work and hope it will be useful for others as well.

Our audience are researchers, analysts and engineers delivering geospatial projects.

We [welcome your comments, suggestions, bug reports and code contributions](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geowrangler/discussions) to make **Geowrangler** better.

## Development

### Development Setup

If you want to learn more about **Geowrangler** and explore its inner workings, you can setup a local development environment. You can run geowrangler's jupyter notebooks to see how the different modules are built and how they work. 

Set up the development environment following the instructions in [DEVELOPMENT](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geowrangler/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)
